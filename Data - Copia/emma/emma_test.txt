She could then see more and judge better . 
It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ’s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . 
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . 
I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . 
Elton , and Miss Hawkins!—Good morning to you . 
There I was quite right . 
Mr. Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ? 
Emma ’s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ’s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least . 
He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . 
This is too bad , cried Emma , as they turned away . 
I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat — just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came — I think the very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?—But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . 
In the way of love , I am sure he does not . 
If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . 
In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off . 
Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? 
Harriet ’s features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . 
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . 
I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . 
but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?—If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too . 
Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . 
I feel it so very due . 
Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before — indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision . 
You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . 
You are very obliging to say such things — but certainly not . 
Now , upon his father ’s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . 
Do not mimic her . 
Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.—Mr . 
Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . 
You understand every thing . 
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ’s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging — not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk — and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . 
It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose . 
if you were to see what a headache she has . 
The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do . 
I was not aware of it myself . 
I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir — I never dine with any body . 
Harriet Smith ’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing . 
She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency — but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time — tiresome women — and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . 
And I have no doubt that he will thrive , and be a very rich man in time — and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us . 
Look at her . 
I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . 
I never compliment . 
She will not even listen to your questions . 
See the consequence of keeping you company!—What do you say to it ? 
If Miss 
The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ’s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . 
Mr. Frank Churchill . 
The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . 
They are jealous even of his regard for his father . 
Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent . 
Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates ’s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . 
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . 
Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton . 
I should not have used the expression . 
I like him very much . 
I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way — allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) . 
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set . 
Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . 
How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! 
The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though May , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant . 
Do not imagine , madam , she continued , that I was taught wrong . 
My friend Robert could not resist . 
I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting . 
What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with very little persuasion . 
No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;—but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . 
ma’am?—And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her — every word of it — I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . 
It was his duty . 
The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs. Weston ’s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o’clock , that she was to think of her at four . 
I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . 
He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more . 
Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . 
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her ? 
They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . 
I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . 
He said nothing worth hearing — looked without seeing — admired without intelligence — listened without knowing what she said . 
”—Mr . 
We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill ’s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . 
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . 
You are prepared for the worst , I see — and very bad it is . 
Dear Emma bears every thing so well , said her father . 
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . 
Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . 
Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . 
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . 
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? 
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be . 
He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father — certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father . 
They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . 
What shall we do to rouse them ? 
Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ’s claims , was to promote Harriet ’s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . 
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . 
I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to — Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss . 
the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr. Elton.—She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . 
She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ’s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . 
If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work . 
Mermaids and sharks ! 
No , no , said Emma , it will not reckon low . 
Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr. Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm . 
Yes : but a young lady — a bride — I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . 
She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , Much the same — not better . 
This made a difficulty . 
So would poor little Harriet . 
No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for — thinks strongly and clearly — and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . 
We are sure of excellent fires , continued he , and every thing in the greatest comfort . 
Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . 
All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley ’s provoking indifference about it . 
Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him . 
The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston ’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . 
This will not be your only visit to Randalls . 
I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:—and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of it is strong on my memory . 
I am sorry for it . 
Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . 
I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house . 
Soft is the very word for her eye — of all epithets , the justest that could be given . 
But what can be the matter?—Is 
no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . 
The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . 
Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston ’s to receive them . 
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love . 
So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage , resumed Miss Bates . 
If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . 
I am a great dreamer . 
It must be a severe trial to them all . 
— He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . 
Much , much beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him , I can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion . 
I am sure William Larkins will not like it . 
no . 
I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . 
Dancing with open windows!—I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . 
I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . 
They were interrupted . 
To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour . 
Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself , said she . 
there is one difficulty unprovided for , cried Emma . 
No , I fancy not , replied Mrs. Elton , with a most satisfied smile . 
It has a disagreeable look to me . 
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . 
I have a great regard for Mr. Perry . 
A superior performer!—very far from it , I assure you . 
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . 
You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . 
He has been wanting to come to us , continued Mr. Weston , ever since September : 
You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . 
You may say 
We shall soon overtake her . 
We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . 
You will laugh at my warmth — but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane 
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . 
You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . 
Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself . 
She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend . 
It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation . 
What is before me , I see . 
One does not , you know , after a time . 
Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To Emma ’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley ’s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.—They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light — first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one — well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse ’s mind.—It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other — in another year or two , perhaps — it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . 
Mr. Woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell , be tempted away to his misery . 
Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society;—it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . 
I know that is the feeling of you all . 
Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her — and with all his mildest urbanity , said , I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . 
And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns — my winter walk . 
Shall I?—Yes , I will — I declare I will — and you shall see how she takes it;—whether she colours . 
you were perfectly right ! 
She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . 
But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax . 
I think we do want a larger council . 
The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . 
A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said , It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . 
There will be a great many people talking at once . 
particular 
Emma ’s confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . 
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . 
Emma ’s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ’s breaking out . 
Mr. Knightley and Harriet!—It was an odd tête - à - tête ; but she was glad to see it.—There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony . 
I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston ? 
Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , said he ; but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . 
How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad to hear such a good account . 
She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . 
It was a sad event — a great shock — with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill do without her ? 
The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . 
party would particularly prize . 
Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! 
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . 
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ’s sketch to wish to go on . 
If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us . 
He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . 
I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . 
Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . 
Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them , could impair.—Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . 
I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy — I am sick of England — and would leave it to - morrow , if I could . 
which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . 
How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! 
She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . 
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . 
You could make it into two parcels , Mrs. Ford , could not you ? 
They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment . 
The evil day was put off . 
This is brilliant indeed!—This is admirable!—Excellently contrived , upon my word . 
Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston ’s time of life ? 
South End is prohibited , if you please . 
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . 
He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates ’s , I fancy , some time — and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much agitated — very much , indeed — to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of — and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . 
Surprizes are foolish things . 
His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse ’s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield . 
How do you like Mrs. Elton ? said Emma in a whisper . 
Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . 
Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . 
Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is . 
This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield — the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . 
I could suppose she might in time — but can she already?—Did not you misunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills — and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?—It was not Harriet ’s hand that he was certain of — it was the dimensions of some famous ox . 
I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . 
I have no doubt of their being happy together , said Emma ; I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . 
So I remember to have heard . 
He told her the news . 
Mr. Elton going to be married ! said Emma , as soon as she could speak . 
I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . 
Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . 
The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother ’s ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton ’s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . 
I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . 
They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her . 

Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . 
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard ’s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to 
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . 
Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit — ( I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon ! 
I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . 
Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a little bit of tart — a very 
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . 
We invalids think we are privileged people . 
It comes to the same thing . 
Mrs. Bates , Mrs. Perry , Mrs. Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . 
He had done his duty and could return to his son . 
Part only of this answer , however , was admitted . 
A man who had been in motion since eight o’clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone!—Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party . 
I am quite sure , he replied , speaking very distinctly , that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . 
Impropriety ! 
Mr. Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? 
She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr. Perry ’s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her.—It was the first intimation of his being returned from London . 
You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . 
This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . 
I knew it was — but had not resolution enough to part with them . 
I do not care for myself . 
No , she had had enough of interference . 
She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , she continued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . 
A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew ’s instant return . 
Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book . 
Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well — It was short — merely to announce — but cheerful , exulting , of course . 
And dear Emma , too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I have been so grieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.—It is a sad change 
You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . 
it was more the intimacy of sisters . 
Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings . 
I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , cried Emma , about your friend Mr. Graham ’s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate . 
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . 

Oh ! 
Yet he would speak . 
I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . 
Oh ! 
No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . 
So began Miss Bates ; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , How is your niece , Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . 
Every body knows what is due to you . 
My mother often talks of your good - nature . 
If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . 
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . 
Difference ! 
How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? 
Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic — I knew nothing of that till this moment — but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!—Oh ! 
She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton ’s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ’s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . 
Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him — but she was very glad to see him . 
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . 
”—He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do , if it be possible . 
And a delightful dance it was to be . 
I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . 
The real evils , indeed , of Emma ’s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . 
But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . 
Did not keep the horses a moment . 
I never heard any county but Surry called so . 
The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . 
Being my friend ’s , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it . 
No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . 
I do not know . 
The strength of the song falls on the second . 
Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . 
obliging!—For my mother had no use of her spectacles — could not put them on . 
Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly . 
She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart . 
Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . 
I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . 
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . 
When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . 
But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . 
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . 
Do not you pity me ? 
Half a dozen natural children , perhaps — and poor Frank cut off!—This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . 
What a thinking brain you have ! 
Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard ’s , ma’am ? asked Mrs. Ford.—“Yes — no — yes , to Mrs. Goddard ’s . 
Are you speaking of — Mr. Knightley ? 
The ladies were all at home . 
You do not know it 
Nothing could be pleasanter . 
Aye , that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . 
If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! 
He continued , Depend upon it , Elton will not do . 
By the bye , said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently , what became of Mr. Perry ’s plan of setting up his carriage ? 
she was not so easily to be talked out of it . 
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment . 
It was Miss Taylor ’s loss which first brought grief . 
It is Frank Churchill ’s duty to pay this attention to his father . 
Dear me ! 
Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come , shake hands with me . 
It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . 
I say , Jane , what a perfect character 
I would give any money for it . 
dear ; I was so miserable ! 
Mr. Martin ! 
He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? 
That will be a much better thing . 
The loss of the ball — the loss of the young man — and all that the young man might be feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it would have been!—Every body so happy ! 
Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him . 
I do not admire it , said Mr. Knightley . 
Harriet said , very true , and she would not think about it ; 
A warm climate may be prescribed for her . 
I am sure I have not got one half so good . 
I had quite determined to go away again . 
We have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked more 
I hope they are quite well . 
My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . 
I never can be blameless . 
She went to Mrs. Goddard ’s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding — to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred — and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . 
Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . 
Now do not you feel that you had ? 
To be sure . 
One can not have too large a party . 
asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . 
Supper was announced . 
Ah!—well — to be sure . 
So mild and ladylike — and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . 
She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . 
It was the end of an old pencil,—the part without any lead . 
She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . 
I can not name a day , said he , till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . 
Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints — I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . 
To a Mrs. Smallridge — charming woman — most superior — to have the charge of her three little girls — delightful children . 
thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received . 
She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . 
We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith ’s collection . 
I do not know , my dear . 
I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . 
We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . 
There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . 
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . 
Enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word . 
One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . 
She is always so attentive to them ! 
Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . 
Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir — or we should not have gone . 
It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . 
Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it . 
When I got to Donwell , said he , Knightley could not be found . 
They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . 
And , indeed , though my mother ’s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! 
Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother — indeed I do not know who is not — and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . 
They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion — to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets — to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy , ) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . 
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . 
But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . 
no — I would get you a better partner than myself . 
She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had told 
I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . 
The persons to be invited , required little thought . 
Quite thick shoes . 
You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . 
Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! 
Good God ! 
At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . 
That ’s a consideration indeed.—But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty . 
Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.—A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .
